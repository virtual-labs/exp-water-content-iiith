For many soils, the water content may be an extremely important index used for establishing  the  relationship  between  the  way  a  soil  behaves  and  its  properties.  The consistency  of  a  fine-grained  soil  largely  depends on  its  water  content.  The  water content is also used in expressing the phase relationships of air, water, and solids in a given volume of soil. Soil mass is generally a three phase system. It consists of solid particles, liquid and gas. For all practical purposes, the liquid may be considered to be water (although in some cases, the water may contain some dissolved salts) and the gas as air. The phase system may be expressed in SI units either in terms of mass-volume or weight-volume relationships. The inter relationships of the different phases are important since they help to define the condition or the physical make-up of the soil. Water content is defined as:
- w = weight of water present in a given soil mass / weight of dry soil = (weight of wet soil sample (W2) - weight of dry soil (W3)) / (weight of dry soil (W3) - weight of container (W1))
- Water content is usually expressed in percent.
